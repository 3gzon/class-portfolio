                    Find out if your company participates in a workplace giving campaign — an annual
                    employer-sponsored program that allows
                    employees to make charitable contributions through payroll deduction and other payment methods.
                    This will allow you to
                    set an automated amount to donate (tax-free) to the Autism Society of America each time you
                    receive a paycheck. Your
                    company may also offer the opportunity to match up to 100% of your contributions so you can
                    double your impact.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are a proud participant in the Combined Federal Campaign (CFC #11808), and many people
                    designate the Autism Society
                    through their company’s United Way campaign and Independent Charities of America. Ask your
                    employer how you can sign up

                                The Autism Society sponsors the largest gathering of people with Autism, families, and
                                professionals at its annual
                                National Conference on Autism spectrum disorders. The National Conference is a two-day
                                conference with presentations and
                                breakout discussions from self-advocates and professionals covering a wide range of
                                topics related to Autism. There you
                                can hear the latest news and developments in the Autism community, meet other
                                individuals and families affected by
                                Autism, and participate in the discussion by sharing your experiences.
                                The National Conference also includes a “Day on the Hill”, where the Autism Society’s
                                staff and board members, along
                                with conference attendees, meet with members of Congress in Washington, D.C. to discuss
                                policy and advocate for the
                                rights of the Autism community. During these days on the hill, community members from
                                states represented by the members
                                of Congress have the opportunity to describe their experiences with Autism to
                                congressional staffers and make them aware
                                of the necessity of these policies. Together we can positively affect change by making
                                our voices heard and rallying for
                                support around services needed for the Autism community.
                                Due to COVID-19, details for the next National Conference are still to be determined.
