                        When family members or support providers become concerned that a child is not following a
                        typical developmental course,
                        they turn to experts, including psychologists, educators and medical professionals, for a
                        diagnosis.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At first glance, some people with Autism may appear to have an intellectual disability, sensory
                        processing issues, or
                        problems with hearing or vision, and the diagnosis of Autism may become more challenging.

                    <p>
                        These conditions can co-occur with Autism and it can be confusing to families when they receive
                        multiple diagnoses.
                        However, it is important to identify Autism, as an accurate and early Autism diagnosis can
                        provide the basis for
                        appropriate educational and home-based support.

                        There are many differences between a medical diagnosis and an educational determination, or
                        school evaluation, of a
                        disability.

                        A medical diagnosis is made by a psychologist, developmental pediatrician, or other specialized
                        physician based on an
                        assessment of symptoms and diagnostic tests. A medical diagnosis of Autism spectrum disorder is
                        most frequently made
                        according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-5, released 2013) of the American
                        Psychiatric Association. This
                        manual guides physicians in diagnosing Autism spectrum disorder according to a specific set of
                        criterion.

                        A brief observation in a single setting cannot present a true picture of someone’s abilities and
                        behaviors. The person’s
                        developmental history and input from parents, caregivers and/or teachers are important
                        components of an accurate
                        diagnosis.

                        While there is not a single behavioral or communication test that can detect Autism, several
                        Autism-specific tools are
                        now being used for formal diagnosis. These include the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule,
                        Second Edition (ADOS™-2),
                        the Autism Diagnostic Interview (ADI), the Screening Tool for Autism in Toddlers (STAT), the
                        Childhood Autism Rating
                        Scales (CARS), and the Tele-ASD-Peds for diagnosis for use in telehealth. All of these tests
                        should be used as part of a
                        larger assessment, and not just on their own, as the determination of Autism is best completed
                        with multiple sources of
                        information.

                        Evaluations typically begin with your primary care provider and vary based on age. If your
                        primary care professional
                        does not wish to refer you to a diagnostician, or does not acknowledge your concerns, it is
                        important to know that you
                        have the right to contact a diagnostician for a second opinion. Check the website of your local
                        Autism Society affiliate

                        Infant and toddler diagnosis begins with voicing your concerns with your child’s pediatrician or
                        primary care doctor. A
                        primary care professional should be able to review your child’s development and conduct a short
                        Autism screening. If
                        that screening indicates that Autism might be a possibility, the doctor may diagnose your child
                        if they have training,
                        especially if Autism characteristics are clearly present. If they do not have Autism-specific
                        training, or if your
                        child’s presentation is subtle or complicated by other factors, they may refer you to an Autism
                        specialist.

                    <p>
                        Most Autism diagnosticians will not diagnose a child until they are at least one-year-old.
                        However, if your child has
                        delays, you can seek services before that diagnosis, often from early intervention federal
                        programs, or from private
                        speech, occupational therapy, or physical therapy clinics. Your primary care professional can
                        give a referral to early
                        intervention or private therapists.

                        Once your child is at least one-year-old, an Autism diagnostician (developmental pediatrician,
                        child psychologist, child
                        psychiatrist) can begin to explore evaluating them. The evaluation will consist of interviews
                        with you, review of
                        records, and an observation of or interaction with your child. See the section on Medical

                        education or the
                        principal of the child’s school. Note: if the child attends a private or parochial school, the
                        parent may need to
                        contact the local public school district for this evaluation. It is important to place an
                        evaluation request in writing
                        and the parents should keep a copy to help track timing of the process. Suggestions for

                    <h3>By Request of School</h3>
                    <p>
                        The school system may determine that an evaluation is necessary. If so, they must receive
                        written permission from the
                        parent before conducting the evaluation.
                        An evaluation should be conducted by a multidisciplinary team or group, which must include at
                        least one teacher or other
                        specialist with specific knowledge in the area of the suspected disability. IDEA mandates that
                        no single procedure can
                        be used as the sole criterion for determining an appropriate education program. The law also
                        requires that the child be
                        assessed in all areas related to the suspected disability, including but not limited to health,
                        vision, hearing,
                        communication abilities, motor skills, and social and/or emotional status.
                        If the parents disagree with the results of the evaluation, they may choose to obtain an
                        independent evaluation at
                        public or private expense.

                        of re-evaluation. For students who already receive special education services, a re-evaluation
                        must take place at least
                        every three years. It may, however, be conducted more often if the parent or a teacher makes a
                        written request. An
                        evaluation may also focus on a specific area of concern. A re-evaluation of all areas of
                        suspected need is necessary if
                        parents feel their child is not making adequate progress towards achieving their IEP goals.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Parents who feel their child’s disability category and related services and support should be
                        changed must have a basis
                        for requesting a re-evaluation. For example, a child may be exhibiting new skill deficits or
                        challenging behaviors. It
                        may be necessary to reassess their placement or develop new behavior techniques to address this
                        area. As a first step,
                        an evaluation by a specialist familiar with Autism-related behaviors could be requested. The IEP
                        can then be changed to
                        reflect the results of the evaluation.

                    <p>
                        For example, a child may have an annual goal to aim at increasing their language production and
                        comprehension skills,
                        but is not meeting the objectives developed in their IEP for this goal. The parent may wish to
                        request a re-evaluation
                        with a speech therapist who is knowledgeable about Autism. It may be determined from the results
                        that an increase in the
                        weekly number of hours of therapy is necessary.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A re-evaluation of all areas of suspected need may come prior to the scheduled annual IEP
                        meeting. If the child has made
                        significant progress since the last evaluation, the treatment, placement, and therapy
                        recommendations may no longer be
                        applicable. A re-evaluation addressing all areas would become the basis for a more appropriate
                        IEP.

                        Parents may suggest that professionals with knowledge of Autism be present at the school for
                        these evaluations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The school does not have to use the suggested professional, but may appreciate the assistance in
                        finding a qualified
                        person. As explained above, if the parents disagree with the school’s evaluation, they do have a
                        right to acquire an
                        independent evaluation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The IEP must be prepared collaboratively and agreed upon before initial placement in special
                        education is made, rather
                        than written after the fact to fit the special education determination.
